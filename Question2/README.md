# Piecewise Recurrence Relation
Based on the folowing piecewise recurrence relation:
### F(n) = F(n-) + F(n-2), where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(2) = 2.
This program ganarates the output of the relation for any inter non-negaitve value of **n** using different 3 ways as follows:
* Using Function Recursion.
* Using Dynamic Programming.
* Using Space Optimization.
